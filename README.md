This repository contains an analysis of the sales generated for three chains of the same coffee shops, across different locations. This analysis spans from January to June of 2023. It will look into sales made from the distinct shops based on their location, products, operating hours, etc. 

OBJECTIVE

To understand the trend of sales across three locations of the coffee shop and seek the best way to optimise on what generates more income or sales for the busimess.

TOOLS USED

Miro - For the planning
Snowflake - For coding in SQL
Microsoft Excel - Analysis, including Pivot tables and charts
Microsoft PowerPoint - For the final presentation 
Canva - Gantt chart creation

WHAT WAS DONE 

First started with planning the project through Miro, by outlining exactly how each column will be utilised. 
Secondly, the coding was done in Snowflake, and the final table was exported to Excel, cleaned, and analysed using pivot tables and graphs.
Third, a PowerPoint Presentation was given to present the findings and provide insights on how best to move forward to achieve greater revenue.

INSIGHTS

What was found was that Hell's Kitchen made the most sales, and that most sales for all three locations were generated in the month of June. 
Mornings are the most popular because more revenue is generated in the morning and not so great in the evenings, so it could be considered to shorten the operating hours for all locations.
Additionally, open another branch in a location that is similar to Hell's Kitchen in order to rake in better sales. 
Some products make very little sales, so they could also eithr be cut out completely or be stocked less.
